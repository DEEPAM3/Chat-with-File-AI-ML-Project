# Chat-with-File-AI-ML-Project

## Overview
Chat-with-File is a deep learning-based document Q&A system that allows users to upload a file and interact with its content through a chatbot interface. The system leverages NLP techniques to extract relevant information from uploaded documents and provide accurate responses.

## Features
- Upload and analyze PDF files
- Extract meaningful content using NLP techniques
- Answer user queries based on the uploaded document
- Interactive chatbot interface

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Chat-with-File.git
   cd Chat-with-File
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Implementation_Chat-with-File.ipynb
   ```

## Usage
- Open `Implementation_Chat-with-File.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
- Upload a PDF file to analyze.
- Input queries related to the uploaded file in the chatbot interface.
- The model will return relevant responses based on the document content.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- Transformers
- PyTorch
- PyPDF2
- NLP libraries (spaCy, NLTK, etc.)

## Future Enhancements
- Extend support for multiple file formats (e.g., DOCX, TXT)
- Improve response accuracy with fine-tuned transformer models
- Deploy as a web application using Flask or FastAPI
